## How to use it?

Keyword 'encrypt' is used to encrypt the text or file.
File is encrypted with password while text doesnt require password.

Keyword 'decrypt' is used to decrypt text or file encrypted by encrypt.

#### Encrypt or decrypt text.
For encrypting or decrypting text, you need to use 'encrypt' or 'decrypt' keywords with '-w'.
  
#### Encrypt or decrypt file
It is same as encrypting and decryping words but you have to use '-f' instead of '-w' and you should keep a password.

##### Example
###### For text
```
encrypt/decrypt -w text
```
###### For file
```
encrypt/decrypt -f filename
```
  
 #### After doing this you need to keep password for encrypting or decrypting a file.
